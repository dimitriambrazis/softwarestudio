In class, I wrote the foo bar baz function.
In addition, I greated this github repository as my lab notebook.  I'm still playing around with it and learning about it,
but it is very intuitive and easy to use.

This week I completed the skills survey on Blackboard.  This assignment reminded me I wanted to learn move about maven
and what it does on a deeper lever.

I updated my foobarbaz code to handle a new divisiblity by 7 rule, and to run for 110 numbers.  I added logic to the first 
if clause so that when a number like 105 came, which is divisible by 3,5, and 7, it would not print foo bar but rather 
baz (per the rules).
