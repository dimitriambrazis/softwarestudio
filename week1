Week 1 | 1/13/2016

In class, I wrote the foo bar baz function.
In addition, I greated this github repository as my lab notebook.  I'm still playing around with it and learning about it,
but it is very intuitive and easy to use.

This week I completed the skills survey on Blackboard.  This assignment reminded me I wanted to learn move about maven
and what it does on a deeper lever.
